src/main/java           Application/Library sources
src/main/resources      Application/Library resources
src/main/filters        Resource filter files
src/main/assembly       Assembly descriptors
src/main/config         Configuration files
src/main/webapp         Web application sources
src/test/java           Test sources
src/test/resources      Test resources
src/test/filters        Test resource filter files
src/site                Site

At the top level files descriptive of the project: a pom.xml file (and any 
properties, maven.xml or build.xml if using Ant). In addition, there are 
textual documents meant for the user to be able to read immediately on 
receiving the source: README.txt, LICENSE.txt, etc.

There are just two subdirectories of this structure: src and target. The 
only other directories that would be expected here are metadata like CVS or 
.svn, and any subprojects in a multiproject build (each of which would be 
laid out as above).

The target directory is used to house all output of the build.

The src directory contains all of the source material for building the project,
its site and so on. It contains a subdirectory for each type: main for the 
main build artifact, test for the unit test code and resources, site and so on.

Within artifact producing source directories (ie. main and test), there is one
directory for the language java (under which the normal package hierarchy 
exists), and one for resources (the structure which is copied to the target 
classpath given the default resource definition).

If there are other contributing sources to the artifact build, they would be 
under other subdirectories: for example `src/main/antlr` would contain 
Antlr grammar definition files.
